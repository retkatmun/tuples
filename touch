# TUPLES
Tuple A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable items in Python. It's like a list, but you can't change its content after creation.also use to store multiple items in a single variable 
## Key Features
Feature	| Description
Ordered	| Items have a defined order

Allows duplicates |	Yes
Indexing |	Access elements by position

```
empty = ()
single = (5,) 
multi = (1, 2, 3)
mixed = ("hello", 42, True)
nested = (1, (2, 3), [4, 5])

```
a single tuple most have a comma just like our example above 

below is how to access a tuple
```
t = (10, 20, 30)
print(t[0])   
print(t[-1])
```
[0] print the item at the begining of a tuple 
[-1] print the item at end of a tuple

tuple operation
```
a = (1, 2)
b = (3, 4)

print(a + b)        # (1, 2, 3, 4) it add the two varaiable together 
print(a * 2)        # (1, 2, 1, 2) it add the number of the present value 
print(len(a))       # 2 this is print the lengh og item in our variable
print(2 in a)       # is 2 in a True, becasue we 2 in our variable a

```
